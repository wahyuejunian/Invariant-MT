# Invariant-MT
Invariant impedances in magnetotellurics (MT) refer to impedance values that remain unchanged under the influence of rotation of the coordinate system. These invariants are useful in reducing the effects of anisotropy and structural complexity in MT data interpretation. By calculating invariant impedances, typically derived from a combination of the XY and YX impedance tensor components, one can obtain more reliable estimates of apparent resistivity and phase. This method, often associated with Malcolm R. Ingham's approach (https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.1988.tb01130.x), helps in analyzing the subsurface without being affected by the orientation of geological structures.
